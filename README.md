# Python Data Structures Testing

A collection of Python scripts for experimenting with and testing various data structures and filtering operations.

## Files

- `filter_dicts.py` - Dictionary filtering with conditions on name and score
- `filter.py` - General filtering utilities
- `most_frequent.py` - Finding most frequent elements
- `number_filter.py` - Number filtering operations
- `string_filter.py` - String filtering operations
- `constant_remove.py` - Removing constants from data
- `test_number_filter.py` - Tests for number filtering
- `test_string_filter.py` - Tests for string filtering

## Purpose

This repository serves as a playground for exploring Python data structures, filtering algorithms, and testing different approaches to data manipulation tasks.
