The Wikimedia Foundation is seeking an experienced and mission-driven Engineering Manager to lead our new Tools Platform Teamâ€”a group dedicated to building and evolving Toolforge, the backbone platform that powers over 3,300 community-built tools responsible for nearly 30% of all edits across Wikipedia and its sister projects. This is a critical leadership role at the intersection of infrastructure and contributor experience. You will guide a team focused on transforming Toolforge into a production-grade platform that is not only reliable and scalable, but also intuitive, inclusive, and empowering for technical contributors at every level of expertise.

PLEASE NOTE: We will only be considering hiring within UTC-3 to UTC+3 due to the geographical location of the team.
